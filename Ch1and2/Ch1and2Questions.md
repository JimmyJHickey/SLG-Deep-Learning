Hello Everybody! Please answer questions for Chapters 1 and 2 below your name.


**1. Do you buy into the hype of AI and machine learning?**

Jimmy: HI there

Alvin: This is my answer!

**2.The authors mention on page 5 that machine learning differs from statistics because it “tends to deal with large, complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would be impractical.  As a result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits comparatively little mathematical theory -- maybe too little -- and is engineering oriented.  It’s a hands-on discipline in which ideas are proven empirically more often than theoretically.”
What are your thoughts on this viewpoint?  What do you see as the similarities and differences between machine learning and statistics?**






**3. Deep learning requires a loss function.  How have you dealt with loss functions in your statistics life so far?  Why do we often use squared error loss?**




**4. Why are classical machine learning algorithms such as SVMs, random forests, gradient boosting, etc., considered "shallow learning," whereas neural nets are considered “deep learning”? Can shallow methods be stacked to emulate neural networks?**





**5. Why is stochastic gradient descent better than regular gradient descent for neural networks?**





**6. How does the concept of momentum apply to SGD?**





**7. What is a tensor, have you seen it before?  Did you understand the section on the dot-product?**





**8. In the compilation step notice you need a loss function, an optimizer, and metrics to monitor during training/testing. In linear regression do we need these as well? If so what are they?**
